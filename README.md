# Parking Trade Application

This app enables individuals who would typically spend large portions of their day searching for parking spots to purchase spots directly from somebody who is currently parked. This collaborative application enabled currently parked cars to list their spot, setup an exchange time, and get paid to trade with another car.

This full-stack peer-to-peer parking service allowed for users to make money and also park more efficiently. P2P capabilities were enabled with Stripe Connect.
